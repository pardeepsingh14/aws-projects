# AWS-Projects

Collection of practical AWS / DevOps mini-projects and exercises by Pardeep Singh.

## About
This repository contains small end-to-end projects demonstrating AWS, Terraform, Docker, CI/CD and troubleshooting skills. Each project has its own folder with a project-level README explaining purpose, how to run, architecture and demo.

## Repository structure
- `project-name/` — each project in its own folder (see template below)
- `.github/workflows/` — CI workflows
- `docs/` — screenshots, architecture diagrams, demo recordings
- `LICENSE` — license
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines

## How to use (for recruiters / reviewers)
1. Browse `docs/` for screenshots / demo GIFs.
2. Open any project folder e.g. `devops-project1/` and read `README.md` for steps to run locally.
3. CI status (if enabled) shows on project README badges.

## Quick showcase (example)
- **DevOps-Project1** — Containerized sample app with Docker + GitHub Actions CI. (link: `projects/devops-project1`)
- **Terraform-ec2-demo** — Basic Terraform to create an EC2 instance and security group.
